# UI-UX-Task1
A modern UI design for a Professional Drone Control System, featuring separate login and sign-up screens.
The color scheme prominently features a warm brown (#9A6520), black variation (#141414), and accents of white (#ffffff), providing a balanced and professional look for the UI. 
Arial, Segoe UI, or Roboto are typical clean and modern font choices suitable for such interfaces, but segues or sans-serif fonts like Segoe UI or Roboto are especially common for clarity and readability. 
Here "Varta", a type of Sans- Serif type is used for font along with Segoe UI Variable font for clearer readability and good user experience.
